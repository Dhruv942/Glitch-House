# glitch.house - take home assignment

This assignment requires you to build a search bar component for a React Native application using Expo. The search bar should provide live suggestions as the user types, and navigating to a dedicated search results page when a suggestion is selected.

## Requirements

-   **Search Bar UI**: Implement a basic input field where users can type their search queries.
-   **Live Suggestions**: Display a dropdown list of matching suggestions as the user types. Each suggestion should include:
    -   A small thumbnail image.
    -   The title of the result.
-   **On Click**: When a user taps on a suggestion, navigate them to a "Search Results" page.
-   **Search Results Page**: Create a separate page to display a list of all results that match the search query. This page should show cards for each result, including the title and potentially view/like counts.

**Bonus:** Feel free to add interactions and transitions to enhance the user experience.

## Design Reference
